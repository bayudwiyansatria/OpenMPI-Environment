# Bayu Dwiyan Satria - OpenMPI

 The Open MPI Project is an open source Message Passing Interface implementation that is developed and maintained by a consortium of academic, research, and industry partners. Open MPI is therefore able to combine the expertise, technologies, and resources from all across the High Performance Computing community in order to build the best MPI library available. Open MPI offers advantages for system and software vendors, application developers and computer science researchers.

Features implemented or in short-term development for Open MPI include:

|           |               |
|   ------  |   ------      |
| Full MPI-3.1 standards conformance        | Many OS's supported (32 and 64 bit)           |
| Thread safety and concurrency             | Production quality software                   |
| Dynamic process spawning                  | High performance on all platforms             |
| Support network heterogeneity             | Portable and maintainable                     |
| Single library supports all networks      | Tunable by installers and end-users           |
| Run-time instrumentation                  | Component-based design, documented APIs       |
| Many job schedulers supported             | Active, responsive mailing list               |
| Network and process fault tolerance       | Open source license based on the BSD license  |
